Lab: Globally-Averaged Temperature			
			
Since the 19th Century, surface weather stations have recorded temperatures at various locations around the world. Only the land portions of the globe are sampled in this way, and the density of stations is greatest in the industrialized nations. Since about 1867, the number and distribution of stations has been large enough to provide an adequate (though not perfect; the sampling error is about 0.07 Â°C) sample of global surface temperature variations from year to year. This record provides the best documentation of recent global climate change and is at the center of the debate over humankind's potential to modify Earth's climate. Satellites, with their global coverage, have been recording a truer estimate of global temperature (in the lower troposphere, not at the Earth's surface) in recent years. However, satellite data exist only since 1980 and are not included in this lab.						
In this lab you will analyze the global temperature record from 1867 to the present. You will evaluate long-term trends and shorter-term fluctuations, and you will look for evidence of the impact of climate forcings and mechanisms of natural variability on the global surface temperature. The ultimate goal is to give you a sense of the difficulties encountered in trying to extrapolate recent temperature trends into the future, and the need for models to make reasoned predictions of temperature change.
